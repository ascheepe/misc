## makemono
Colors are really hard on the eyes for me so this is a simple filter
to convert them to a grayscale version in different hues. I mainly
use it for converting the terminal color scheme under x/wayland.

## ula
Creates random private ipv4 and ipv6 network addresses.

## wordfreq
Creates a top N list of the most common words. This is just an exercise
in creating and managing a hash table.

## packbits
RLE en- and decoder for the packbits algorithm. Not sure if it's compliant
but I use it in some old dos programs to compress graphics.
